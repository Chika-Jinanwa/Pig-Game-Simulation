# Pig-Game-Simulation
Built and implemented a simulation of the two dice pig game using the random and matplotlib libraries in Python. The matplotlib library was used to produce a line plot of players' running scores after each turn. The rules of the game are as follows:There are at least 2 players; ● Each player rolls two standard dice. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the player’s total score, and the turn ends; ● If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing, and the turn ends; ● If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost, and the turn ends; ● Whoever accumulates 23 points first wins. ● If more than 1 player accumulates 23 points or more in the same turn, then the game ends in a tie, and all players with 23 points or more win. The maximum number of players is 4. You can find more about the pig's game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game) I created this simulation because I was interested in knowing if the order of game play affects the chances of winning and the line graph produced confirms my belief.
